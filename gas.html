                    <p>Bonjour! My name is Tiffany Anastasia Jocelyn. Computer Science student at IPB University. Born in Jambi, December 10th 2004. I claim myself as a consistent person. This statement exists because of a strong spirit of ambition in carrying out several things that affect my life.   </p>
                    <p>I like science because it provides a lot of things that need to be explored. So, as time goes by, I like to learn about many new things, especially working in professional matters. Because, these activities support and realize my career interests in the future.</p>
                    <p>I am a tech-enthu especially in data science. This started with the AIESEC organization where I, as a Talent Analytic Specialist in Talent Intelligence, provided me with some statistical knowledge. This gives me more interest so that I want to deepen even more about this knowledge.</p>
                    <p>However, behind all my activities, I also have a hobby of listening to music, especially western and KPOP songs. Of course, I'm a KPOP-enthu. Many of the songs they performed warmed my heart and mind. </p>

                    <h2>Learning is limitless</h2>
                    <p>I'm pretty sure that education is the key to freedom. For a better world, study and spread knowledge. Read, grow, and change the world</p>
